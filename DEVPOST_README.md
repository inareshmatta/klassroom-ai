## Inspiration

Modern education relies heavily on static PDFs, textbooks, and one-way lectures. When a student doesn't understand a concept, they are forced to **leave their study material** — to search Google, watch a YouTube video, or use a generic ChatGPT interface. This breaks focus and strips away the direct context of what they were studying.

We were inspired to solve this by bringing a **proactive, multimodal AI agent directly into the textbook**. Instead of the student asking the AI questions in a separate chatbox, the AI:

- 👀 **Watches** the student study (sees the exact PDF page and diagrams)
- 👂 **Listens** to their voice in real-time
- 🗣️ **Speaks back** with low-latency, natural voice tutoring
- 🧠 **Thinks** autonomously — triggering quizzes, visuals, and dictionary lookups without being asked

---

## What it does

KlassroomAI takes any uploaded textbook (PDF) and wraps it in a **multimodal AI orchestration layer**, transforming static studying into an interactive, AI-guided experience.

### 🎙️ 1. Real-time Spoken Tutor (Zero-Latency Voice)

At its core, KlassroomAI features a **voice-first proactive tutor** powered by the **Gemini 2.5 Flash Native Audio** API.

| Feature | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Natural Conversation** | Students speak naturally; the AI responds in a warm, human-like voice with <500ms latency |
| **True Barge-in** | Binary PCM audio streams via WebSockets allow instant interruption — say "Wait, explain that again" mid-sentence |
| **Contextual Awareness** | The tutor reads the current PDF page text, analyzes visible diagrams, and adapts its teaching in real-time |
| **Precise Audio Scheduling** | Uses `AudioContext.currentTime` scheduling instead of event-loop queues to eliminate stuttering and lag |

### 🤖 2. Autonomous Agentic Behaviors

The AI tutor isn't just a chatbot — it acts as an **autonomous orchestration agent** that decides when to use its tools:

| Tool | Trigger | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| `generate_quiz` | After explaining a topic | A quiz panel slides out with MCQs, True/False, and Fill-in-the-Blank questions |
| `lookup_word` | Student encounters unfamiliar term | Google Search-grounded dictionary with IPA pronunciation, etymology, and contextual definition |
| `suggest_next_topic` | Student finishes a concept | AI guides them to the next logical topic based on curriculum and prerequisites |
| `create_bookmark` | Student highlights important text | Content is saved to the Knowledge Vault for revision |

### 🖼️ 3. Visual Explainer (Nano Banana 2)

Some concepts are impossible to understand through text or voice alone.

- If a student says *"I'm confused about the Krebs Cycle"*, the orchestration agent triggers the **Visual Explainer**
- The UI seamlessly slides out a panel that generates an **infographic, flowchart, or concept map** on the fly
- These visuals are **grounded by Google Search** results, ensuring factual accuracy over hallucination
- The student can iteratively **refine** the visual: *"Make it simpler"* or *"Add more detail about ATP"*

### 👁️ 4. Native PDF Pixel Interactivity & Vision

We discarded the traditional "upload PDF and chat" paradigm in favor of **deep DOM integration**:

- **Click any word** → instant dictionary lookup with IPA pronunciation, etymology, subject-specific definition
- **Highlight a sentence** → save it to the **Knowledge Vault** for revision sheets
- **🔖 Save** from the tooltip → pushes word + definition to your vault
- **🎨 Visualize** from the tooltip → opens the Visual Explainer pre-filled with that concept
- **👁️ Explain Page & Diagrams** → extracts a **pixel-perfect snapshot** of the current page canvas (capturing all charts, graphs, images) and sends it to the **Gemini Vision model**. The voice tutor then **verbally explains the diagram** you are looking at.

### 📅 5. Predictive AI Curriculum Planner

Students input their exam date and available daily study hours:

- AI analyzes the length and complexity of the uploaded textbook
- Dynamically generates a **personalized, week-by-week study schedule**
- Three pedagogical phases: **📖 Study → 🔄 Revision → 📝 Practice Tests**
- Progress tracking with checkable tasks and a visual progress bar
- Reset timeline capability if the student falls behind

## Challenges we ran into

| Challenge | Root Cause | Our Solution |
|---|---|---|
| 🔴 **20-30s audio lag** | Recursive `onended` event-loop queuing on the main thread | Refactored to precise `AudioContext.currentTime` scheduling on the audio thread |
| 🔴 **1008 Policy Violation disconnects** | `speech_config` block unsupported by Native Audio preview models | Stripped config to minimal dict matching official Gemini Live API docs |
| 🟡 **PDF text misalignment** | Custom bounding-box detection was slow and inaccurate | Migrated to `pdf.js` native `TextLayer` for pixel-perfect DOM overlay |
| 🟡 **Barge-in trailing audio** | Old audio chunks kept playing after interruption | Added `interrupted` event handler that calls `.stop()` on all active `BufferSource` nodes |
| 🟡 **API key leaked to GitHub** | `.env` committed before `.gitignore` was in place | Google auto-revoked key; we scrubbed git history and rotated the key |
